  <h1>Volume 4</h1>
  <h2>Volume 4: NCTI and the Pursuit of Antinoise (1985–1989)</h2>
<p>In 1985, shortly after I resigned from Techland Systems, I received a phone call that would define the next chapter of my life. The call was from <strong>Mike Parrella</strong>, a man I had met a year earlier at a Techland event held at the Plaza Hotel in New York. Mike had been running a company called Pilone, focused on compiler technologies, but was now in the process of taking over a failing public company named <strong>NCTI</strong> (Noise Cancellation Technologies, Inc.). He remembered our conversation and was intrigued by my perspective on emerging technologies.</p>
<p>Mike had partnered with <strong>Jay Haft</strong>, a high-powered deal attorney, and together they offered me a pivotal role in the transition of NCTI. My first assignment: fly to England and <strong>secure a technology licensing agreement with the University of Essex</strong>. The goal was to acquire the rights to a new patent by <strong>Professor Malcolm Chaplin</strong> — a technology that used <strong>FFT-based signal analysis to cancel periodic noise</strong>.</p>
<p>It’s important to clarify that Chaplin’s patent <strong>wasn’t for compression</strong>. It was a sophisticated approach to suppressing <strong>periodic acoustic or vibrational noise</strong>, such as engine hum or propeller whine. While the theoretical model was sound, it was up to us to make it practical — and marketable.</p>
<h3>Meeting Professor Chaplin</h3>
<p>I traveled to Essex and met with Professor Chaplin, where I negotiated and closed the licensing deal. The technology showed promise, but to turn it into a working product, we would need engineering talent capable of transforming theory into functioning prototypes. That’s when I thought of <strong>Eldon Ziegler</strong>.</p>
<h3>Eldon Ziegler and Adaptive Filtering Innovation</h3>
<p>Eldon was an elite systems engineer I’d met years earlier through <strong>Neil Colvin</strong>. He had led some of the earliest U.S. programming projects — including a military aircraft control system — and had recently retired from <strong>Time Warner</strong>, where he served as lead technologist. Eldon had also served on the <strong>Harvard Technical Advisory Board</strong> and once shared the dais with <strong>Angela Merkel</strong>.</p>
<p>At NCTI, Eldon began developing an alternative approach: <strong>adaptive filtering</strong> to cancel <strong>random noise</strong> — rather than periodic. His method, grounded in deep mathematical modeling, was novel and patentable.</p>
<p>One of his first demonstrations involved a <strong>platter filled with water</strong> disturbed by a transducer. Once the noise cancellation system was turned on, the <strong>water went completely still</strong> — a visually striking confirmation that our system worked. This was the same demonstration I gave during an appearance on <strong>Good Morning America</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>✅ Note: Eldon’s later invention of <strong>Recursive Markov Modeling (RMM)</strong>, which became critical to my AI forecasting work, didn’t come until <strong>2019</strong> and was not part of his work at NCTI.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Building Momentum</h3>
<p>In 1986, <strong>John McCloy Jr.</strong> joined NCTI’s board. His father, <strong>John McCloy Sr.</strong>, had been one of the most influential private citizens of the 20th century — having run the <strong>Marshall Plan in Germany</strong> after WWII and negotiated the settlement of the <strong>Cuban Missile Crisis</strong>. John Jr. brought a gravitas to the company and helped arrange major financing efforts, including a promising deal with the <strong>Bank of Bermuda</strong>. Unfortunately, the <strong>1987 market crash</strong> derailed the financing just before closing, plunging the company into a lean phase.</p>
<p>We continued to work relentlessly. I split my time between our offices in <strong>Great Neck</strong> and Eldon’s lab in <strong>Columbia, Maryland</strong>, commuting multiple days per week. Our efforts culminated in a series of <strong>U.S. and international patent filings</strong>, some of which now bear both Eldon's and my name.</p>
<h3>Sales, Government Interest, and Missed Deals</h3>
<p>During this time, I conducted <strong>technical sales presentations to military agencies</strong>, including one to the <strong>Secretary of Defense at the Pentagon</strong>. Our demonstrations caught the attention of various branches of government and major corporations. I remember one inquiry from <strong>NASA</strong>, which asked whether we could <strong>cancel the noise from a rocket launch</strong>. In theory, yes — but practically, you’d need a “reverse rocket” to emit anti-noise at the same scale. Still, the question illustrated how far the imagination was stretching.</p>
<p>I also visited <strong>Germany</strong>, particularly <strong>Munich</strong> and <strong>Hamburg</strong>, where I met <strong>York Seiler</strong>, who showed me a <strong>poster-sized full-color printer</strong> he had built from scratch — in 1987! On that trip, I attended a <strong>Herbert von Karajan</strong> concert with the <strong>Berlin Philharmonic</strong>, his final performance before his death. I also visited <strong>East Berlin</strong>, a chilling and sobering contrast to the West, during the height of the Cold War.</p>
<h3>Competition and the Market</h3>
<p>One of the companies we paid close attention to was <strong>Bose</strong>. I met with <strong>Amar Bose</strong> himself at their factory in Massachusetts. At the time, Bose was using <strong>acoustic methods</strong> for sound suppression, not electronic. Their focus was more audio than structural. Eventually, NCTI would go on to develop <strong>noise-canceling headphones</strong> and other commercial products — years after I left the company. In the late '90s, Eldon even sent me a few working pairs. They were impressive.</p>
<h3>Personal Rewards</h3>
<p>From 1985 through 1989, I worked nearly full-time on NCTI. I was a central figure in establishing its engineering foundation, partnerships, and public image. I gave numerous <strong>interviews</strong>, including one for a show called <strong>Innovations</strong> on a cable tech channel. For my work, I received <strong>stock compensation</strong>, and when I sold that stock in the early 1990s, it was worth <strong>$1.5 million</strong>.</p>
<p>One of our U.S. patents, assigned to NCTI, still bears <strong>my name alongside Eldon’s</strong>. I even have the commemorative <strong>plaque</strong> in my home office.</p>
<p>This period — while intense — solidified many of the skills I had developed at Techland. It also proved that I could take a raw, esoteric technology and move it into real-world applications. It prepared me for what would come next: a move into <strong>consumer electronics</strong> with one of the most interesting and misunderstood technologies of the 1990s.</p>
