  <h1>Volume 2</h1>
  <h2>Volume 2: College, Counterculture, and Early Computing (1968–1978)</h2>
<p>I started college at the age of 16 in the fall of 1968. From the beginning, I made a conscious decision to be more outgoing. I started talking to everyone on the bus ride to Queens College and immediately joined a house plan called Knight House, which had its own space on Roosevelt Avenue in Flushing. Most of the other members were older and more experienced, including two friends who would become influential in my college years — Michael Berkeley and Art Fishman. I saw Knight House as a hub of social activity and mentorship.</p>
<p>Registration was chaotic that first semester. The gymnasium was filled with long tables labeled for different departments. You had to figure out which classes to register for without any clear guidance and hope you made it in before the lists filled. I signed up for a mix of liberal arts, physics, math, and an introductory computer science course.</p>
<p>That fall, I attended a Halloween party hosted by Knight House. It was my first real social event at college, and I had a great time. There was a giant garbage can filled with what everyone called “bash” — a potent mixture of fruit punch, cut-up fruit, and various alcohols. After that night, I began casually dating a few different girls over the next few months. It wasn’t until early the following year that I met Debbie at another Knight House party — and that meeting would eventually lead to our trip to Woodstock.</p>
<p>On my <strong>17th birthday</strong>, the first day I was legally allowed to drive solo under New York law (having already passed both Driver's Ed and the road test), I drove to Queens College and spent an hour looking for parking — eventually having to walk three-quarters of a mile to class. Later that night, I drove to the house plan to meet friends. That turned into an impromptu adventure: they convinced me to drive all the way into <strong>Chinatown</strong> — an ambitious trip for someone’s first legal day behind the wheel. I don’t recall whether we crossed the Manhattan or Williamsburg Bridge, but I do remember this became a tradition. <strong>Every Friday night at 11 PM</strong>, we would pile into the car and drive to the <strong>same Chinese restaurant</strong> in Chinatown. <strong>Pork chow fun cost $0.80</strong> and <strong>shrimp chow fun was $1.25</strong> — cheap eats and great memories.</p>
<p>One frustrating academic experience was my introductory computer science class. The professor, a Czechoslovakian man with a heavy accent, scribbled indecipherable equations on the board without explanation and offered no textbook or structure. I also struggled with submitting FORTRAN programs to the Xerox mainframe — punching cards and waiting days to find out if your code had a syntax error. These two experiences turned me off from majoring in computer science — a major decision that would later be dramatically reversed by my hands-on PC experience.</p>
<p>During <strong>intercession breaks</strong> in January, I took some memorable trips. In <strong>1970</strong>, I flew with friends to <strong>Puerto Rico</strong> and stayed at a hotel I can’t quite recall. It was warm, social, and fun. Then in <strong>1972</strong>, I flew to <strong>Las Vegas</strong> with a math buddy and stayed at the <strong>Flamingo Hotel</strong>. We took a side trip to the <strong>Grand Canyon</strong>, flying on a small aircraft that gave me serious nausea while flying through the canyon. Despite that, I snapped dozens of photos with my <strong>Nikon F3</strong>. After returning to Vegas, I was still queasy — but played blackjack at the Flamingo while <strong>chugging Pepto-Bismol at the table</strong>. I knew basic strategy from reading <em>Beat the Dealer</em>, and surprisingly, I kept winning — enough that casino personnel started watching me. It was my first sense of what it felt like to win against the odds.</p>
<p>In 1970, Queens College dropped required courses, likely due to student protest. That gave me freedom to craft a self-directed curriculum. I took music appreciation and learned about the structure of classical music — including the <strong>four movements of symphonies</strong>, and forms like <strong>sonata</strong>, <strong>theme and variation</strong>, and <strong>rondo</strong>. It deepened my love of music and showed me how mathematical music really was.</p>
<p>In the spring of 1970, while building a replica of the college’s administration tower for a <strong>Knight House carnival exhibit</strong>, I was standing at the top hammering boards into place when I suddenly saw <strong>stormtroopers marching across the lawn</strong>. We later found out a riot had broken out in the cafeteria — students had thrown chairs through windows in response to <strong>Kent State</strong>, and police had been called in. <strong>The semester ended early.</strong></p>
<p>The following year (1971), classes ended early again. That fall, students were even <strong>given two weeks off in October for “political activity.”</strong> My friends and I used it to <strong>road-trip to Washington, D.C.</strong>, though our goal was sightseeing, not activism.</p>
<p>Sometime during the <strong>summer of 1973</strong>, I was paired in a golf round at Douglaston Golf Course with a woman named <strong>Barbara</strong> and her father. We hit it off, and although we dated briefly, we mostly became close friends. Through Barbara, I met <strong>Bryan Popko</strong>, who was a distributor for a company called <strong>SYBERVISION</strong>. That connection would become life-changing. SYBERVISION, founded on neuropsychological principles, offered programs like <em>The Neuropsychology of Achievement</em> and <em>The Neuropsychology of Self-Determination</em>. These taught you to <strong>reprogram your brain</strong> to overcome limiting beliefs, build confidence, and change behavior through mental rehearsal and visualization.</p>
<p>I took their personality self-assessment and scored <strong>9 out of 12</strong> on their “achievement traits” — meaning I already had a strong base. The training helped me <strong>fine-tune</strong> my habits. It was my first exposure to self-directed psychological transformation. Decades later, <strong>Scott Adams’ books</strong>, especially <em>Win Bigly</em>, further confirmed what I had learned — that memory is not fixed, it is rewritten, and understanding how our brains simulate confidence, identity, and belief is the key to unlocking success. Along the way, <strong>Gary Null’s work</strong>, like <em>Who Am I Really</em>, gave additional reinforcement. All of this helped shape the strategic way I’ve approached every opportunity in life — understanding how mindset is malleable and ultimately programmable.</p>
<p>In 1974, I returned to college after taking a year off to help run <strong>Ace Brass</strong> when my father had a heart attack in <strong>1973</strong>. I was now serious about graduating and took three <strong>18-credit terms</strong>, completing my degree by <strong>December 1975</strong>. I also took a course called <strong>Theoretical Mechanics</strong> taught by <strong>Dr. Banesh Hoffmann</strong>, Einstein’s former collaborator and biographer. The course covered advanced topics like <strong>Laplace's method for small oscillations</strong>, <strong>special and general relativity</strong>, and required you to <strong>write out your thinking</strong> — not just the answer. Even when I got answers wrong, he would give me <strong>A+ for my reasoning</strong>. After the class, he wrote a recommendation letter saying I was the <strong>best student he had taught in over 30 years</strong> and that he <strong>expected great things</strong> from me. I still have the letter to this day.</p>
<p>In January 1975, while still in college, I bought the <strong>MITS Altair 8800</strong>, a kit computer featured on the cover of <em>Popular Electronics</em>. Building it was <strong>painstaking</strong> — it had only <strong>256 bytes of memory</strong>, and everything had to be hand-assembled. Eventually, I added static RAM and connected a <strong>Teletype ASR-33</strong>, which I used to input programs. It wasn’t until months later that I received a paper tape of <strong>Microsoft BASIC</strong>, which had been delayed due to legal issues with <strong>Pertec</strong>. With BASIC, I wrote an <strong>invoicing and accounts receivable system</strong> for Ace Brass that used <strong>cassette tapes for storage</strong> and printed documents on the Teletype.</p>
<p>By late 1975, I was using an <strong>IMSAI 8080</strong> with an <strong>8&quot; floppy drive</strong> (160K capacity) and running <strong>CP/M</strong>. I was also attending <strong>computer festivals</strong>, helping small businesses using <strong>TRS-80s</strong>, and buying software from <strong>Lifeboat Associates</strong> — setting the stage for my next career move.</p>
<p>In <strong>May 1978</strong>, I married <strong>Joann</strong>. Later that year, we bought our first house in <strong>Douglaston</strong>.</p>
<p>Volume 2 ends there — a decade of exploration, technology, self-development, and personal transformation.</p>
