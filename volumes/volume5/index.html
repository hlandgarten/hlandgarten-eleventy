  <h1>Volume 5</h1>
  <h1>Volume 5: The Casino Years, Networking, and the Vegas Era (1990–2000)</h1>
<p>The 1990s were a defining decade — a time when my business success, love of golf, and interest in market dynamics intersected with the glitz and opportunity of Las Vegas. Through a unique blend of technology, trading, and serendipitous connections, I found myself at the center of a world filled with high-stakes deals, celebrity encounters, and global networking.</p>
<h2>The Bellagio Opening and Vegas in Full Bloom</h2>
<p>The opening of the Bellagio was one of the most extraordinary weekends of my life. Joann and I were flown out on a private jet, checked into our suite before even leaving the plane, and treated to a series of lavish events.</p>
<p>The weekend included:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>command performance by Cirque du Soleil</strong></li>
<li>Two concerts by <strong>Andrea Bocelli</strong></li>
<li>A formal dinner where <strong>Van Cliburn performed piano</strong></li>
<li>The <strong>grand debut of the Bellagio fountains</strong>, which left us awestruck</li>
</ul>
<p>It wasn’t just entertainment — it was an immersion into the Illuminati circle of Las Vegas.</p>
<h2>Kenny Rogers and the Power of Presence</h2>
<p>At one point during the Bellagio opening brunch, Joann found herself snubbed by people we had flown in with from New York. Seeing <strong>Kathy Azzinaro</strong>, a casino host she knew, she struck up a conversation — only to find Kathy chatting with <strong>Steve Wynn</strong> and <strong>Kenny Rogers</strong>. Kenny spent ten minutes talking to Joann. When she returned, the same people who had previously rejected her were now clamoring to make space at their table.</p>
<h2>VIP Life in Las Vegas</h2>
<p>That weekend wasn’t a one-off. Joann and I became frequent guests at elite events in Las Vegas:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mystère at Treasure Island</strong> — we saw it over 100 times</li>
<li><strong>EFX at the Las Vegas Hilton</strong> — a Broadway-style spectacular we attended dozens of times, featuring rotating stars like <strong>Tommy Tune</strong></li>
<li>Countless <strong>Super Bowl parties, Chinese New Year events</strong>, and <strong>New Year’s Eve galas</strong></li>
<li><strong>Rodney Dangerfield show</strong>, where we were seated in a central booth alongside <strong>Danny Gans</strong> and his wife. Danny was a top impersonator at the time, and we had seen him perform many times.</li>
</ul>
<h2>NASCAR, Callaway, and Golf Contacts</h2>
<p>I was invited to drive a <strong>NASCAR stock car</strong> at 180 mph on the Las Vegas Speedway. I had to climb in and out through the window — there was no door.</p>
<p>Later, I was flown to the <strong>Callaway factory in Southern California</strong>, where I was personally <strong>fitted for custom clubs</strong>, which they shipped directly to me.</p>
<p>I formed many <strong>business relationships on the golf course</strong>, especially at <strong>Shadow Creek</strong>, where I played multiple pro-am rounds. One such encounter was with a principal of <strong>D&amp;H Distributing</strong>, which eventually led to a <strong>technology distributorship</strong> I ran between 2005 and 2008. Joann and I even had dinner with his boss at the <strong>Beverly Hills Hotel</strong> shortly after that round.</p>
<h2>The Beginning of Online Trading and Networking</h2>
<p>Back in New York, I had obtained my first Internet connection via <strong>Pipeline.com</strong> and was experimenting with early market data services. I built one of the earliest <strong>futures trading bots</strong>, using insights I gathered from an AIQ seminar on volatility expansion in Miami. Trades were executed through a modem connection to my broker, who would call the pits — this was before the days of electronic trading.</p>
<p>Eldon Ziegler, my brilliant engineering partner, wrote the communication software that transmitted the trades. He wasn’t involved in the trading logic, but the partnership laid the groundwork for future innovations.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>This decade blended innovation, exploration, and indulgence — from building one of the first trading bots to dancing at New Year’s Eve parties with the Las Vegas elite. The world was changing fast, and I was living at the edge of technology and opportunity.</strong></p>
