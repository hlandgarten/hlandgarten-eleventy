  <h1>Volume 6</h1>
  <h1>Volume 6: Reinvention and Missed Revolutions (1998–2004)</h1>
<p>By the late 1990s, the world of technology was changing fast — and so was I.</p>
<h2>Seeing the Future at CES</h2>
<p>In 1998, I attended CES and stumbled upon a device that would reshape my perspective on how software and data could redefine user experience: <strong>TiVo</strong>. The moment I saw it, I understood what it meant — not just a digital video recorder, but a model for <strong>time-shifting</strong>, <strong>personalization</strong>, and ultimately <strong>control</strong> over media.</p>
<p>That experience rewired my thinking. It wasn’t just the TiVo — it was the <strong>concept</strong> behind it. CES in those days was a treasure trove of paradigm shifts waiting to be discovered. TiVo was the spark that got me thinking seriously about how technology could empower people — something that would influence many of my decisions in the years to come.</p>
<h2>Switching to Linux</h2>
<p>Around the same time, I began exploring <strong>Linux</strong>. I started with <strong>Red Hat 7</strong>, which I installed from CD. That later became Red Hat 8 and 9, and I ran Linux as my primary operating system. But every major update required a clean install, and I found that frustrating. That led me to search for a <strong>rolling release distribution</strong> — and I discovered <strong>Gentoo</strong>, which I’ve used ever since.</p>
<p>Linux wasn’t just a hobby. It became my <strong>primary computing platform</strong> and part of my <strong>philosophy</strong> — one rooted in <strong>control</strong>, <strong>transparency</strong>, and <strong>efficiency</strong>.</p>
<h2>Embedded Linux and Samsung Thermostat Project</h2>
<p>One project in particular stands out: <strong>a thermostat controller developed by Samsung</strong>. Eldon Ziegler designed the system, and I built the embedded Linux software to run it. This was well before the era of smart homes and IoT appliances. It was a clear example of our vision: <strong>efficient, dedicated systems</strong>, engineered for performance, powered by open-source technology.</p>
<h2>Compusport: Biomechanics and Golf</h2>
<p>As you know, golf has been a lifelong passion. So when I saw the <strong>Compusport</strong> technology, I had to be part of it. They had developed a system that could record your golf swing and <strong>superimpose it over a model of the perfect swing</strong>, created by biomechanical analysis from Olympic-caliber athletes.</p>
<p>The results were extraordinary. Using my method of training — assigning the analytical side of my brain to observe while the subconscious executed the motion — I was able to quickly adapt my swing to match the model. Their coaches often said they’d never seen anyone with my combination of <strong>mental agility</strong> and <strong>physical flexibility</strong>.</p>
<p>In fact, they would often say: <em>“Any pro on the tour would sell his soul for the flexibility you have.”</em> I attribute that to having started the game young and keeping at it my whole life.</p>
<h2>Samsung CCTV Investment</h2>
<p>By <strong>early summer 2004</strong>, things heated up with one of my more lucrative ventures — an investment in <strong>Samsung CCTV</strong>. After <strong>two months of negotiation</strong>, I sold my stock — and my father-in-law’s — for a total of <strong>$2 million</strong>.</p>
<p>David Weiner, the friend who led the group that bought our shares, later told me, <em>“You’re the toughest negotiator I’ve ever dealt with.”</em> I’m not sure if that’s true, but it stuck with me.</p>
<p>That deal was a major milestone — both financially and psychologically. It closed a chapter and opened the way for new ventures.</p>
<h2>Hello Network: The Almost-YouTube</h2>
<p>Around the same time, I was asked by a fellow investor in Samsung CCTV to evaluate a company called <strong>Hello Network</strong>, based in Las Vegas. They had a novel system for streaming <strong>video over the internet</strong>, based on <strong>Java</strong>.</p>
<p>I spent <strong>two weeks</strong> on-site evaluating their team and technology. Technically, it was sound — though I wasn’t thrilled about the reliance on Java. Still, I saw the potential. A few weeks later, I arranged an investment meeting at <strong>Bear Stearns</strong> in New York, where Hello Network’s CEO, <strong>Craig</strong>, was to pitch.</p>
<p>I warned Craig that talking about <em>everything</em> his tech could do — all 20 or 30 possible use cases — would make him sound scattered. I told him to <strong>focus</strong> on one or two killer applications.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, he didn’t listen.</p>
<p>At the meeting, Craig told Bear Stearns about <strong>everything</strong> — all the possible use cases, all the hypothetical markets. The meeting fell flat. It was a missed opportunity.</p>
<p>And I always remembered that moment because <strong>Hello Network had real potential</strong>. They were very close to being <strong>what YouTube would eventually become</strong>.</p>
<p>To make matters worse, I had worked hard to get them in front of Bear Stearns. That was their shot — and it was squandered. It taught me that <strong>vision must be paired with focus</strong>, or it all slips away.</p>
<hr>
<p>These years — from 1998 to 2004 — were about <strong>recognizing revolutions</strong>, adapting quickly, and knowing when to commit and when to walk away. I missed some things. I made others work. But the lessons I learned during this time continue to shape how I see innovation — and opportunity — today.</p>
<h3>A Hole-in-One in Mobile, Alabama</h3>
<p>As part of a Compusport meeting, I traveled to Mobile, Alabama, where we held our annual golf outing. On the morning I was set to return home — with a connection through Atlanta to meet Joann in Orlando — I decided to play the front nine of the Legislator Course at Capitol Hill.</p>
<p>The fifth hole on that course featured an elevated tee, a picture-perfect green surrounded by trees, and a lake in front of it. The hole measured about 160 yards. When I struck my tee shot, I knew immediately that it was headed straight for the pin. Because of the glare of the sun, we couldn't actually see it land, but we heard a loud clank.</p>
<p>When we got to the green, we found that my ball had gone directly into the hole on the fly — a hole-in-one, right into what we joked was the clown’s mouth. That meant I had to finish the round to make the hole-in-one official, which I did. However, I missed my scheduled flight and had to drive all the way to Atlanta to catch up with my travel plans.</p>
<p>It was a perfect example of how golf, serendipity, and timing continued to intersect in my life.</p>
