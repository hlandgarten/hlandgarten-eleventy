## Lifeboat, Xedex, and the Transition to Techland

I was first introduced to Lifeboat Associates as a customer. I had been buying software for my business when I received a call from Tony Gold, who offered me a job. My first assignment was to initiate *Lifelines*, a monthly newsletter. I became its editor, wrote monthly editorials, and was also put in charge of bringing in new software and managing our software catalog — including negotiating software royalty contracts and interfacing with numerous software developers.

Lifeboat was a hub of early microcomputer software distribution, and I had extensive interaction with developers from Micro Focus, TeaMaker, and others. I made several trips to Austin, Texas, and developed a strong relationship with the Balcones brothers, who were behind several of the early productivity software packages. During my time there, I also helped Ford Motor Company develop a PC strategy and presented it to upper management at the Renaissance Center in Detroit. I was deeply involved in the emerging personal computer ecosystem, meeting many people who would later become famous — including Bill Gates, with whom I had numerous conversations.

I also played a role in the birth of *PC Magazine*. I was present at the meeting with David Bunnell that led to its launch.

Through my relationship with Neil Colvin and Mike Aaronson — Mike had previously developed the P-Mate text formatter — I suggested that Phoenix Technologies should focus on third-party BIOSes, which became a crucial part of the PC clone revolution. On a trip to an Intel developer conference with Neil, we visited Microsoft’s still-under-construction campus and were given a personal tour by Bill Gates himself.

In 1983, I left Lifeboat to form *Xedex* with an outside investor. Roland Joffe, then Lifeboat's head of marketing, joined me, along with his assistant Rebecka and Bob, who had been Lifeboat’s BIOS engineer. Roland hired Burson-Marsteller, one of the top PR firms in the country, and set up our offices in the Burlington House on Sixth Avenue with views of Central Park. Bob established a hardware lab in Suffern, New York, to manufacture our products — including a board called **Baby Blue**, designed to make the IBM PC compatible with CP/M software.

Although Baby Blue achieved some early success and press attention, hardware issues with Bob's designs led to internal friction. I left Xedex, taking Roland and Rebecka with me to form *Techland Systems*, leaving Bob and the investor with Xedex and the Baby Blue product.

## Sale to York Research and Becoming Public (1985)

Techland grew quickly. With Richard Clowes, an ex-IBM top salesperson, we grew the company to over 50 employees. We released communication-focused products, including **Blue Lynx**, which connected PCs to IBM mainframes using 3270 emulation and supported Twinax connections to IBM System/34 and /36 machines. Our software was sophisticated, and thanks to connections from Neil Colvin, we licensed core technologies from elite programmers like Reid Smith, Bob, and Ken Campbell — one of the top communications programmers in the country.

Our client list grew rapidly, and in our first year, Techland did over $2 million in sales, with major contracts from New England Life, R.J. Reynolds, and the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. We traveled the world — including several trips on the Concorde — to support Techland UK and build global business relationships.

In 1985, *York Research Corporation* acquired Techland Systems, making us part of a publicly traded company. This marked a major milestone in my entrepreneurial journey and set the stage for the next phase of my career.

## Founding Techland Systems

After the initial challenges with Xedex and its Baby Blue product for the IBM PC, I, along with Roland Joffe and Rebecka, left to found **Techland Systems**, leaving Bob with the investor. We established our new company at **Waterside Plaza** on Manhattan’s East Side, overlooking the East River. Richard Clowes, a former top IBM salesperson, joined shortly afterward.

Our first goal was to bridge the gap between personal computers and IBM mainframes. This began with the development of a powerful **IBM 3270 emulator** that enabled IBM PCs to connect directly to mainframe systems.

This required not only an **add-in card** that could support synchronous modem protocols but also **sophisticated software**. Reid Smith and Bob, two elite communications programmers introduced by Neil Colvin, were instrumental in developing the early software stack. Later, we hired **Ken Campbell**, one of the top communications programmers in the country.

## Blue Lynx and Twin Lynx

The **Blue Lynx** software suite enabled seamless communication between PCs and IBM mainframes. Later, we developed **Twin Lynx**, which extended this functionality to **IBM System/34** and **System/36** environments.

These solutions received strong interest from financial institutions and enterprises. Among our largest early wins were:
- **New England Life**
- **RJ Reynolds**
- **Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco**

We achieved **$2 million in revenue in our first year** of operations.

## Company Growth

Techland quickly grew to more than **50 employees**, with development and support teams spread across multiple time zones. I was often traveling — both for sales and technical meetings — across Europe and Asia.

We opened **Techland UK**, which was established through multiple **trips on the Concorde** to London, where I helped set up European distribution. I also traveled extensively to **China**, **Malaysia**, and other Southeast Asian countries as we explored partnerships and OEM opportunities.

Our office in New York remained our headquarters. The East River views were inspiring — a reminder of how far we had come from our humble beginnings soldering early Altair kits.

## Press and Publicity

Our products received strong press coverage and were featured in trade publications. Here's a list of some of the media coverage and key product documents (available in the `images` folder):

This period marked a pivotal evolution in my career: from experimenting with audio and personal computing to running a globally expanding tech company with real influence in the enterprise computing space.
