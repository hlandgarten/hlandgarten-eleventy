# Volume 6: Reinvention and Missed Revolutions (1998–2004)

By the late 1990s, the world of technology was changing fast — and so was I.

## Seeing the Future at CES

In 1998, I attended CES and stumbled upon a device that would reshape my perspective on how software and data could redefine user experience: **TiVo**. The moment I saw it, I understood what it meant — not just a digital video recorder, but a model for **time-shifting**, **personalization**, and ultimately **control** over media.

That experience rewired my thinking. It wasn’t just the TiVo — it was the **concept** behind it. CES in those days was a treasure trove of paradigm shifts waiting to be discovered. TiVo was the spark that got me thinking seriously about how technology could empower people — something that would influence many of my decisions in the years to come.

## Switching to Linux

Around the same time, I began exploring **Linux**. I started with **Red Hat 7**, which I installed from CD. That later became Red Hat 8 and 9, and I ran Linux as my primary operating system. But every major update required a clean install, and I found that frustrating. That led me to search for a **rolling release distribution** — and I discovered **Gentoo**, which I’ve used ever since.

Linux wasn’t just a hobby. It became my **primary computing platform** and part of my **philosophy** — one rooted in **control**, **transparency**, and **efficiency**.

## Embedded Linux and Samsung Thermostat Project

One project in particular stands out: **a thermostat controller developed by Samsung**. Eldon Ziegler designed the system, and I built the embedded Linux software to run it. This was well before the era of smart homes and IoT appliances. It was a clear example of our vision: **efficient, dedicated systems**, engineered for performance, powered by open-source technology.

## Compusport: Biomechanics and Golf

As you know, golf has been a lifelong passion. So when I saw the **Compusport** technology, I had to be part of it. They had developed a system that could record your golf swing and **superimpose it over a model of the perfect swing**, created by biomechanical analysis from Olympic-caliber athletes.

The results were extraordinary. Using my method of training — assigning the analytical side of my brain to observe while the subconscious executed the motion — I was able to quickly adapt my swing to match the model. Their coaches often said they’d never seen anyone with my combination of **mental agility** and **physical flexibility**.

In fact, they would often say: *“Any pro on the tour would sell his soul for the flexibility you have.”* I attribute that to having started the game young and keeping at it my whole life.

## Samsung CCTV Investment

By **early summer 2004**, things heated up with one of my more lucrative ventures — an investment in **Samsung CCTV**. After **two months of negotiation**, I sold my stock — and my father-in-law’s — for a total of **$2 million**.

David Weiner, the friend who led the group that bought our shares, later told me, *“You’re the toughest negotiator I’ve ever dealt with.”* I’m not sure if that’s true, but it stuck with me.

That deal was a major milestone — both financially and psychologically. It closed a chapter and opened the way for new ventures.

## Hello Network: The Almost-YouTube

Around the same time, I was asked by a fellow investor in Samsung CCTV to evaluate a company called **Hello Network**, based in Las Vegas. They had a novel system for streaming **video over the internet**, based on **Java**.

I spent **two weeks** on-site evaluating their team and technology. Technically, it was sound — though I wasn’t thrilled about the reliance on Java. Still, I saw the potential. A few weeks later, I arranged an investment meeting at **Bear Stearns** in New York, where Hello Network’s CEO, **Craig**, was to pitch.

I warned Craig that talking about *everything* his tech could do — all 20 or 30 possible use cases — would make him sound scattered. I told him to **focus** on one or two killer applications.

Unfortunately, he didn’t listen.

At the meeting, Craig told Bear Stearns about **everything** — all the possible use cases, all the hypothetical markets. The meeting fell flat. It was a missed opportunity.

And I always remembered that moment because **Hello Network had real potential**. They were very close to being **what YouTube would eventually become**.

To make matters worse, I had worked hard to get them in front of Bear Stearns. That was their shot — and it was squandered. It taught me that **vision must be paired with focus**, or it all slips away.

These years — from 1998 to 2004 — were about **recognizing revolutions**, adapting quickly, and knowing when to commit and when to walk away. I missed some things. I made others work. But the lessons I learned during this time continue to shape how I see innovation — and opportunity — today.

## A Hole-in-One in Mobile, Alabama

As part of a Compusport meeting, I traveled to Mobile, Alabama, where we held our annual golf outing. On the morning I was set to return home — with a connection through Atlanta to meet Joann in Orlando — I decided to play the back nine of the Legislator Course at Capitol Hill.

The eleventh hole on that course featured an elevated tee, a picture-perfect green surrounded by trees, and a lake in front of it. The hole measured about 170 yards. When I struck my tee shot, I knew immediately that it was headed straight for the pin. Because of the glare of the sun, we couldn't actually see it land, but we heard a loud clank.

When we got to the green, we found that my ball had gone directly into the hole on the fly — a hole-in-one, right into what we joked was the clown’s mouth. That meant I had to finish the round to make the hole-in-one official, which I did. However, I missed my scheduled flight and had to drive all the way to Atlanta to catch up with my travel plans.

It was a perfect example of how golf, serendipity, and timing continued to intersect in my life.
