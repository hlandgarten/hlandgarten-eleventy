## Volume 4: NCTI and the Pursuit of Antinoise (1985–1989)

In 1985, shortly after I resigned from Techland Systems, I received a phone call that would define the next chapter of my life. The call was from **Mike Parrella**, a man I had met a year earlier at a Techland event held at the Plaza Hotel in New York. Mike had been running a company called Pilone, focused on compiler technologies, but was now in the process of taking over a failing public company named **NCTI** (Noise Cancellation Technologies, Inc.). He remembered our conversation and was intrigued by my perspective on emerging technologies.

Mike had partnered with **Jay Haft**, a high-powered deal attorney, and together they offered me a pivotal role in the transition of NCTI. My first assignment: fly to England and **secure a technology licensing agreement with the University of Essex**. The goal was to acquire the rights to a new patent by **Professor Malcolm Chaplin** — a technology that used **FFT-based signal analysis to cancel periodic noise**.

It’s important to clarify that Chaplin’s patent **wasn’t for compression**. It was a sophisticated approach to suppressing **periodic acoustic or vibrational noise**, such as engine hum or propeller whine. While the theoretical model was sound, it was up to us to make it practical — and marketable.

### Meeting Professor Chaplin

I traveled to Essex and met with Professor Chaplin, where I negotiated and closed the licensing deal. The technology showed promise, but to turn it into a working product, we would need engineering talent capable of transforming theory into functioning prototypes. That’s when I thought of **Eldon Ziegler**.

### Eldon Ziegler and Adaptive Filtering Innovation

Eldon was an elite systems engineer I’d met years earlier through **Neil Colvin**. He had led some of the earliest U.S. programming projects — including a military aircraft control system — and had recently retired from **Time Warner**, where he served as lead technologist. Eldon had also served on the **Harvard Technical Advisory Board** and once shared the dais with **Angela Merkel**.

At NCTI, Eldon began developing an alternative approach: **adaptive filtering** to cancel **random noise** — rather than periodic. His method, grounded in deep mathematical modeling, was novel and patentable.

One of his first demonstrations involved a **platter filled with water** disturbed by a transducer. Once the noise cancellation system was turned on, the **water went completely still** — a visually striking confirmation that our system worked. This was the same demonstration I gave during an appearance on **Good Morning America**.

> ✅ Note: Eldon’s later invention of **Recursive Markov Modeling (RMM)**, which became critical to my AI forecasting work, didn’t come until **2019** and was not part of his work at NCTI.

### Building Momentum

In 1986, **John McCloy Jr.** joined NCTI’s board. His father, **John McCloy Sr.**, had been one of the most influential private citizens of the 20th century — having run the **Marshall Plan in Germany** after WWII and negotiated the settlement of the **Cuban Missile Crisis**. John Jr. brought a gravitas to the company and helped arrange major financing efforts, including a promising deal with the **Bank of Bermuda**. Unfortunately, the **1987 market crash** derailed the financing just before closing, plunging the company into a lean phase.

We continued to work relentlessly. I split my time between our offices in **Great Neck** and Eldon’s lab in **Columbia, Maryland**, commuting multiple days per week. Our efforts culminated in a series of **U.S. and international patent filings**, some of which now bear both Eldon's and my name.

### Sales, Government Interest, and Missed Deals

During this time, I conducted **technical sales presentations to military agencies**, including one to the **Secretary of Defense at the Pentagon**. Our demonstrations caught the attention of various branches of government and major corporations. I remember one inquiry from **NASA**, which asked whether we could **cancel the noise from a rocket launch**. In theory, yes — but practically, you’d need a “reverse rocket” to emit anti-noise at the same scale. Still, the question illustrated how far the imagination was stretching.

I also visited **Germany**, particularly **Munich** and **Hamburg**, where I met **York Seiler**, who showed me a **poster-sized full-color printer** he had built from scratch — in 1987! On that trip, I attended a **Herbert von Karajan** concert with the **Berlin Philharmonic**, his final performance before his death. I also visited **East Berlin**, a chilling and sobering contrast to the West, during the height of the Cold War.

### Competition and the Market

One of the companies we paid close attention to was **Bose**. I met with **Amar Bose** himself at their factory in Massachusetts. At the time, Bose was using **acoustic methods** for sound suppression, not electronic. Their focus was more audio than structural. Eventually, NCTI would go on to develop **noise-canceling headphones** and other commercial products — years after I left the company. In the late '90s, Eldon even sent me a few working pairs. They were impressive.

### Personal Rewards

From 1985 through 1989, I worked nearly full-time on NCTI. I was a central figure in establishing its engineering foundation, partnerships, and public image. I gave numerous **interviews**, including one for a show called **Innovations** on a cable tech channel. For my work, I received **stock compensation**, and when I sold that stock in the early 1990s, it was worth **$1.5 million**.

One of our U.S. patents, assigned to NCTI, still bears **my name alongside Eldon’s**. I even have the commemorative **plaque** in my home office.

This period — while intense — solidified many of the skills I had developed at Techland. It also proved that I could take a raw, esoteric technology and move it into real-world applications. It prepared me for what would come next: a move into **consumer electronics** with one of the most interesting and misunderstood technologies of the 1990s.
