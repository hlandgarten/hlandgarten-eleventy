I was born with a certain outlook on life — one that, like many things, has turned out to be both a blessing and a curse.

I’m endlessly curious — but more than that, I have an obsessive need to figure things out. I don’t stop until I understand how something works and what it’s made of.

Over the years, I’ve explored so many different subjects that when a new technology appears, I often know instantly whether it solves a problem I’ve seen before. Because I’ve already internalized the mechanics of so many systems, I can spot connections others might miss.
That instinct has often led to opportunity — sometimes in ways I could never have predicted.

I’ve also had the good fortune to live through one of the most extraordinary eras in history — a time when innovation accelerated year after year, reshaping how we live, think, and connect.
From the dawn of the personal computer to the rise of artificial intelligence, I witnessed — and often worked directly with — the tools and ideas that transformed the world.

As I share the story of my life, I’ll pause now and then to dive deeper into particular moments, technologies, or experiences. Some of these will be full stories in their own right — rich with details, ideas, or insights I’ve never shared before.
Even when a topic may seem familiar, I hope to offer a new perspective — one that helps you see it in a different light.

Whenever you see a button inside a story, it's an invitation to explore further — to follow me into a more focused tale, a personal discovery, or an explanation of something I once had to figure out the hard way.
