# Fort Dix

## Prologue
In December 2024, following the latest in a long series of obstacles placed in my path by the DOJ and CFTC, I reported to Fort Dix Prison Camp. This chapter is separate from my main memoir volumes because what happened there — from near-death experiences to absurd bureaucratic decisions — deserves its own telling.
