# 1964–65 World’s Fair: The Greatest Show on Earth

In the fall of 1963, my parents had planned to take me to see *It’s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World* for my birthday. It had just opened at the Warner Cinerama Theatre in Times Square — a comedy spectacular shown on a giant curved screen with stars in every frame. But the day before my birthday, President Kennedy was assassinated. Theaters went dark. Everything stopped.

I eventually got to see the movie, and later *How the West Was Won* — both in Cinerama — and both bursting with the kind of optimism and scale that would soon define the 1964–65 World’s Fair.

## The Journey to Tomorrow — Rough Roads and High Expectations

By summer 1964, I was ready to experience the Fair. But getting there was another story. The **Long Island Expressway**, part of our regular route to Ace Brass and the official path to the Fair, was in terrible shape — full of cracked pavement, construction delays, and summer heat buckling the concrete. **It felt like riding a stagecoach across the Old West.**

## Unisphere

## Other Highlights

- **AT&T’s Videophone**: A working demo of a future where you could see who you were talking to.
- **New York State Pavilion**: Giant terrazzo floor map, elevator towers, and a UFO-like observation deck.
- **Westinghouse Time Capsule**: A sealed message to the year 6939.
- **Hall of Science**: A modernist showcase of atomic energy and hands-on learning.

## A World in a Few Blocks

But the Fair wasn’t just a display of American innovation — it was a **global village**. Walking through the International Zone felt like taking a whirlwind tour of several countries in one afternoon.

### Belgian Village & Waffles

Though I was there as a 12-year-old, my wife later shared one of her earliest memories — the **Bel‑Gem / Brussels waffles** at the Belgian Village, crisp and warm, served with fresh strawberries and whipped cream. They cost about $1 and became the fair’s most talked-about treat. The Village itself was modeled on old Flemish streets, complete with a cobblestone square, shops, a carousel, and folk dancers in traditional costume. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}

### Vatican Pavilion & Michelangelo’s Sistine Chapel Ceiling

Inside the **Vatican Pavilion**, millions stood in reverent silence as they were carried past *Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel Ceiling* on a moving walkway. It was the second‑most visited pavilion after GM and remains one of the Fair’s most powerful moments.

### Republic of China Pavilion  

Nearby was the **Republic of China Pavilion**, a vivid red-and-gold structure modeled on an imperial palace and filled with silks, jade, and artifacts. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}

### Other Notable Pavilions

Other pavilions left their mark too:
- The **Philippines Pavilion**, shaped like a woven hat and surrounded by a moat, featured native dance, carvings, and tropical art.
- The **African Pavilion**, a cooperative effort among more than twenty nations, showcased modern art, film, and cultural exhibits in a non‑colonial, post‑independence context. 

It was the first time I came to understand that culture and the future were more than just gadgets — they were ideas, identities, and global stories. And even if I didn’t taste a waffle that day, those memories feel vivid through someone else’s spark.



## A Legacy of Wonder

The Fair didn’t just show off gadgets — it offered **a coherent, optimistic vision of the future**. For a kid in love with science and imagination, it was life-shaping.

It echoed the promise of *Star Trek*, *The Outer Limits*, and *Get Smart*. It validated every fantasy I had about technology making the world better.

“Just like the Cinerama screen that opened my eyes, the Fair pulled back the curtain on what was possible — and left me wanting to build part of that future myself.”

Even if the road to get there was bumpy, the 1964–65 World’s Fair made one thing clear: **the future was already under construction — and I wanted to be part of building it.**
